# final-project-group-4
##Notes from our last meeting

  * Adding a column for the printers name (which it's location/model is in it's name)
  * The spacing in the table
  * Dynamically adding brand names

We also talked about templating and the HTML and implementing the JS. An example name of a printer would be "AH 244 - HP Officejet Pro X476dw PS"
