##Notes from our last meeting

  * Adding a column for the printers name (which it's location/model is in it's name)
  * The spacing in the table
  * Dynamically adding brand names

We also talked about templating and the HTML and implementing the JS. An example name of a printer would be "AH 244 - HP Officejet Pro X476dw PS"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome work so far. The only thing left would be the ability to entirely remove a printer from the page and some sort of alert whenever a inventory quantity falls below a settable number.

After that it's templating and whatever new server/database stuff we learn in class.
